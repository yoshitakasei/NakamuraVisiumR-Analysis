# NakamuraVisiumR-Analysis
An analytical tool to be used with the 10X Visium platform to compare spatial gene expression values.

This tool was designed with the following considerations:
1. A 10X Visium spatial gene expression assay was completed to generate .CLOUPE file(s).
2. Using the Loupe Browser application from 10X Genomics, a user exported .CSV files of all the gene expression levels in their tissue regions of interest.
3. A user wants to know which genes are differentially expressed between 2 groups within defined regions of interest.
